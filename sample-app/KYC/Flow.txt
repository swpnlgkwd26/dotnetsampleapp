 Purpose 
  -  Controller =>  View  
 
 1. ViewBag : 
    - dynamic 
    - ITs object
    -  that can hold properties
    -  ITs automatically available to view to View

 Best Practice 
   -  Build Model  : Class
  Adv 
 -  Intellisense

 How to display data on view
  - Razor Syntax :  C# 
  -  .cshtml :   it will contain C# Plus HTML
  -  @ symbol

 2. Repository Pattern :  Loosely coupled
 -  We built an interface : IStoreRepo
 -  Implement it : Class  :  PRoduct In memory 


 Dependency Injection
  - All the Depednet objects are provided from outside
 -  Interface, Class , ctro Injection , service.AddScoped : To point Interface to apporpriate class

  Problem  
   - Intellisense
 2. ViewData :  is Equivalent to ViewBag and its old way.

 Day 4
  - DI  Service LifeTime Scope
  1. Singleton :  Single Object
  2. Scoped :  Per Request
  3. Transient : Everytime Its resolved

  Layout
   - MasterPage 
   - RenderBody : ContentPlaceholder
   - ViewStart.cshtml :  To apply Layout page to all views

 ViewImport. cshtml => To make available path of the folder to every view that contains a model

 Day 5
 Custom middleware


 Day 7
  - Model Validation

   1. Data annotations :  Way of adding validation logic in our application

   Attributes
   1. Required , Range, CC,Email..... . Add this attribute in class
   2. you need to use Modelstate.Isvalid :  this check whether the sTate of the model is valid or not and then
   only execute a logic
   3.  Add Validation Messages

   Best Practive
    - View should never be attached directly to model
    - We should use ViewModel Layer
    - View should directly communicate only to view model .. then this view model
     is converted into model required in Data access logic
